# Smart Retractable Speed Breaker System

A smart QR-authenticated system to allow **uninterrupted passage of emergency vehicles** by automatically retracting speed breakers — improving response times and road safety.

---

## Overview

This project solves the delay caused by traditional speed breakers for emergency vehicles while maintaining control for regular traffic.

> Authorized vehicle → speed breaker retracts  
> Unauthorized vehicle → speed breaker remains raised

---

## Objective

- Improve reach time for ambulances, police, and fire services  
- Ensure real-time vehicle validation  
- Automate road infrastructure using IoT and QR verification

---

## Core Components

- QR-based vehicle detection  
- Actuation mechanism for retraction  
- Mobile + embedded integration (ESP32)

---

## Hardware Used

- ESP32 × 2  
- Servo Motors  
- Ultrasonic Sensors  
- Camera Module / QR Reader  
- LCD Display + Timer
- Buzzer & LEDs  
- Prototyping Wires, Breadboard, or PCB
